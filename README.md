Stepping into the word of microcontrollers, LED Matrix Display board, but failed big time :(

#Throwback
Month of October 2020, The peak of COVID-19, during the lockdown, Due to lack of socialization the boredom began to reach it's top. The endless scrolling through YouTube to find anything interesting, i randomly came across this " DIY-LED DISPLAY MATRIX BOARD" Video. 

That's the day i decided to brush up my hibernating passion in electronics. All the tools were with me and i bought a 1000 Red LEDs to start doing this LED MATRIX Display. Ordered ICs, transistors, resistors, PCBs and an Arduino UNO.

I've used Arduinos before for small DIYs with LDR,IR etc but never understood how it worked or how to make the code of my own. But with a pocket full of confidence i decided to go for it.

started doing...

first Made a single panel of LED (8x8) with matrix connection
for testing purpose, if it works later i can expand that was the thought.

Secondly, Laid out all the components like IC base, resistors & transistors on a zero PCB and planned the spaces and connections.
Soldered the connections as it was in the circuit provided in the tutorial.

Picture only took to show off my soldering skills( which i believed i had at that time)

Connected the LED Panel & Arduino nano with the Circuit that I've made, uploaded the code, What more to say... the LEDs lit up, But never worked.

The only ouutput i got is

Since i don't know the working, basic circuits, or anything, i was never able to solve the issues i faced. 

The project was closed with no hopes...

I'll make it work someday.
